# AIS_anomaly_detection
## Introduction
We takes inspiration from  TREAD* (Traffic Route Extraction and Anomaly Detection)[1], that
learns a statistical model for maritime traffic from AIS data in an unsupervised way
## Dataset
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: https://marinecadastre.gov/accessais

The information contained in the AIS data (generally) are of dynamic and static type

Area of interest: **Hawaii**

A bounding box is selected and it corresponds to the (chosen) specific area under surveillance
